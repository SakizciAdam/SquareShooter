# Square Shooter
A multiplayer game about shooting squares?

## Why?
This "game" was created to test my networking skills. There is not much to the game.
80% of the code is just networking. You can play LAN or use port forwarding to play with others. 

## How do I play with others?
First of you need a friend. The host has to use port forwarding. The port is 41244. 
Then select join a game. Enter their IP. If the host does not know their IP. Tell them to  google "what is my ip". 



## FAQ

#### What game engine did you use?

I did not use any game engine as a challenge. Just the [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/chrisdill/raylib-cs) as a graphics library.

#### I encountered a bug, what do I do?

Create a issue explaning the situation. 

#### Random crash?

The netcode is not foolproof. So if a client or a server sends a weird packet it might crash. I fixed all the crash bugs I could find but there is probably some that I missed.

#### No sounds?

The game has no sounds.
If you want to add some, create a pull request :)
