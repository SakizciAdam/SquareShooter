# Square Shooter
A multiplayer game about shooting squares?

## Why?
This "game" was created to test my networking skills. There is not much to the game.
80% of the code is just networking. You can play LAN or use port forwarding to play with others. 

## How do I play with others?
First of you need a friend. The host has to use port forwarding. The port is 41244. 
Then select join a game. Enter their IP. If the host does not know their IP. Tell them to  google "what is my ip".
